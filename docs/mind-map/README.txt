This web of mind-maps started as a way to figure out the connections between different parts of the HPX source-code during my internship at CSCS in March-June 2017. After a few weeks I realised other people new to HPX might benefit from this way of viewing the code and the connections between it, especially since the HPX documentation leaves quite a few questions unanswered. I hope you will find these maps helpful.

Start by opening the map called "README" to get a glimpse of the color code and see a table of content.

If you want to fully enjoy the features of the map (eg tabs, hyperlinks, rolling and unrolling branches) as well as edit it, please open the .xmind file with XMind (http://www.xmind.net/, open-source except for pro features, mind-mapping software).
Otherwise, you are welcome to navigate the map in html, svg or jpeg format.

This map is by no means complete, and the HPX code is constantly evolving and expanding: contributions and comments are more than welcome, either directly on GitHub (https://github.com/shoshijak/hpx/tree/mind-map) or by email (as.jak@protonmail.ch)

Happy mapping!
